# Crime Prediction And Analysis

This project consists of two Jupyter Notebook files: **Crime_Prediction_clustering.ipynb** and **Crime_Pred_analysis.ipynb**. These notebooks analyze crime data and make predictions based on clustering and analysis techniques.

## Instructions:

1. **Upload CSV File:**
   - Before running the notebooks, upload the CSV file named **MCI_2014_to_2019.csv** into your Google Colab environment.

2. **Update File Paths:**
   - In the second cell of both **Crime_Prediction_clustering.ipynb** and **Crime_Pred_analysis.ipynb**, update the file path to point to the location where you uploaded the **MCI_2014_to_2019.csv** file.

3. **Run Cells:**
   - After updating the file paths, run each cell in the notebooks to generate visualizations and predictions.

## File Descriptions:

- **Crime_Prediction_clustering.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on crime data clustering analysis.
- **Crime_Pred_analysis.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on crime data analysis and predictions.

## Note:

- Make sure to have necessary libraries installed in your environment.
- If running in Google Colab, ensure you have a stable internet connection.
